162, Project 1  

I did this project in my Intro to Programming II course to learn about OOP, input validation, makefiles, and classes.  


This project implements Langton's Ant, and allows the user to customize the size of the array, the number of steps, the location of the ant, or the option of a default or a random ant starting location.   
This program requires header and implementation files for the Ant and Board classes and the validateInput library and the makefile.   
Please run 'make' and './Proj1' or 'make memcheck' or 'make clean'
